# ðŸŒ± The Garden - A C++ Farming Game

Welcome to **The Garden**, a minimalist farming simulation game developed in C++ using the SFML library. Created during my first year of the Master's program at Seatech Engineering School, this project was a hands-on exercise in object-oriented programming, resource management, and game loop design.

Inspired by titles like **Minecraft** and **Stardew Valley**, The Garden offers a relaxing and repetitive gameplay loop centered around cleaning, planting, harvesting, and selling crops â€” all within a small pixelated farm.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Overview

You spawn in a small farm called **The Garden**, where nature has taken over. Your mission is simple:

1. **Clean the Field**  
   Remove rocks, trees, grass, and flowers cluttering the soil.

2. **Harvest the Ground**  
   Prepare the cleaned tiles so theyâ€™re ready for planting.

3. **Plant Beans**  
   With the field ready, plant bean seeds and wait patiently for them to grow.

4. **Reap and Sell**  
   Once your beans are ripe, harvest and sell them to earn coins.

5. **Reinvest**  
   Use your earnings to buy more seeds and expand your tiny farming empire!

Rinse and repeat the cycle for as long as you like. The game is meant to be chill and cyclical â€” a small homage to farming sims with a minimalist twist.
